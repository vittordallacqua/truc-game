### 💠 Main Components

- **`model/Card.java`**  
  Represents a playing card with attributes like suit and rank.

- **`model/Deck.java`**  
  Manages the deck of cards, including shuffling and dealing.

- **`model/Player.java`**  
  Defines player attributes and actions, such as playing a card or calling "Truco".

- **`model/Game.java`**  
  Contains the core game logic, managing rounds, scorekeeping, and enforcing rules.

- **`Main.java`**  
  Entry point of the application, initializing the game and handling user interactions.

- **`resources/game_rules.txt`**  
  Provides a textual description of the game's rules and instructions.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

- **Card Dealing:**  
  Randomly shuffles and deals cards to players at the start of each round.

- **Turn-Based Play:**  
  Players take turns playing cards, with the game determining the winner of each hand.

- **Truco Calls:**  
  Implements the "Truco" challenge mechanism, allowing players to raise the stakes.

- **Score Tracking:**  
  Keeps track of each player's score, determining the winner when a player reaches the target score.
