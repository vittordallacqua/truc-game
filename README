Truc Game in Java
=================

The project is structured using OOP principles, with separate 
classes for different game components, promoting modularity and 
reusability. The game interacts with the user via the console, 
prompting for inputs and displaying game states. The codebase is 
designed to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements such 
as GUI integration or networked multiplayer support.

The game is able to randomly shuffles and deals cards to players
at the start of each round. The players take turns playing cards, 
with the game determining the winner of each hand. It Implements the 
"Truco" challenge mechanism, allowing players to raise the stakes. 
It keeps track of each player's score, determining the winner when a 
player reaches the target score, and ensures that all game rules are 
followed, including valid card plays and responses to "Truco" calls.
